Modify this rule to define if null values impact whether clauses are included or excluded.\n\nDEFAULT BEHAVIOR: false() - Null values in the FAR matrix are not evaluated when identifying clauses to include when multiple \nclause types are selected. This aligns with the published FAR Smart Matrix logic on acquisition.gov.\n\nEx. Clause set uses FP_SUP and CR_SRV contract types.  The FAR Matrix defines clause 52.211-5 as required for FP_SUP, but \ndoes not define any usage for CR_SRV.  Based on the published FAR Smart Matrix, 52.211-5 would NOT be included in the clause matrix.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION STEPS:\n\n1. Replace the false value with true to include null value\n\nEx. Clause set uses FP_SUP and CR_SRV contract types.  The FAR Matrix defines clause 52.211-5 as required for FP_SUP, \nbut does not define any usage for CR_SRV.  Based on this customization, 52.211-5 would be included as required in the clause matrix.\n\n2. The value of this expression should only be one of the two available below\n\nEXPECTED OUTPUT TYPE: Boolean with the value of true or false\n\n*/\nfalse()",
